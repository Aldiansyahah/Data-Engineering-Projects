## Description
* This repo contains projects done which applies principles in data engineering. 

* Why did I want to learn more about data engineering?

* The ideal scenario is to marry data engineering and analytics, to formulate efficient and accurate queries to address business use cases

## Projects
---
1. Postgres ETL
* This project looks at data modelling for a fictitious music startup Sparkify, applying STAR schema to ingest data to simplify queries that answers business questions the product owner may have

2. Cassandra ETL
* Looking at the realm of big data, Cassandra helps to ingest large amounts of data in a NoSQL context. This project adopts a query centric approach in ingesting data into data tables in Cassandra, to answer business questions about a music app

3. Web Scrapying using Scrapy, MongoDB ETL
* In storing semi-structured data, one form to store it in, is in the form of documents. MongoDB makes this possible, with a specific collection containing related documents. Each document contains fields of data which can be queried. In this project, data is scraped from a books listing website using Scrapy. The fields of each book, such as price of a book, ratings, whether it is available is stored in a document in the books collection in MongoDB.
